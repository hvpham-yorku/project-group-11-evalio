### ITR1-6: What-If Scenario (Stretch)
Assigned to:  Bardiya
Tasks:  
- Implemented what-if scenario testing as **read-only analysis** (no persistence): compute projected final grade using existing weighted-grade logic without modifying stored grades.  
- Added automated unit tests covering: (1) real grades unchanged after what-if, (2) boundary inputs 0 and 100, (3) repeated what-if calls produce consistent results.  
- Documented design decision: **no scenario persistence in ITR1** (scope control), defer multi-scenario saving/comparison to later iterations if time.
